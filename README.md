# John Silkey's React Portfolio!
See it deployed at: https://quiet-reef-58934.herokuapp.com/

## Description:

An updated web portfolio that integrates more modern technologies and patterns I've been practicing, such as CSS modules, higher order components (like withRouter), and more. I also painstakingly tested the webpage on all screen sizes, and found that it looks best on mobile screens (adjust the screen size and see for yourself!). Hope you enjoy it!

## Technologies Used:

- React.js front-end architecture (in ES6);
- React Router V4 for SPA UI;
- Deployed on Heroku with Node/Express back-end;
- CSS Modules for building local (non-global) styling rules;
- React-Bootstrap V3 plus my own custom-built card components;
- Mobile-first UI/UX (it definitely looks better on mobile screens!);
- React-media for media queries which affect presentation at component level;
- Integrated Babel plugins for constructor-less class components and property initializers;
- Included prop-types library to improve debugging efficiency during development;
- Webpack configuration to handle compiling / minifying .css and image files, enabling CSS Modules to properly hash CSS class names so as to guarantee global uniqueness;
- Webpack-dev-middleware and webpack-hot-middleware for live webpack compiling of React components emitted from a live server in development mode;
- Production-mode webpack configuration to ensure proper minification of assets.
